### Getting started

First of all, DONâ€™T PANIC. 
It will take 5 minutes to get the gist of what Order generator is all about.

#### Requirements

##### Python

You need to have a recent version of Python installed. 
See the [Python](python.org) page for actual information.

To work with RabbitMQ and MySQL, you must also install additional Python modules using the command: 

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### RabbitMQ

Understandably, to work with it, we need the message broker itself. 
To avoid problems with the program, please install [RabbitMQ](rabbitmq.com) from its page.

##### MySQL

In conclusion, we need the MySQL for the full operation of the application.
It will be enough to install only the MySQL Server. 
On the page [MySQL](mysql.com) you can find a free community version of the server, or purchase it.

#### Running

To run the application in normal mode, use the command:

```bash
python3 program.py
```

After starting the application will create a database and tables in it. 
As well as the exchange point and queue in the message broker. 
As soon as preparation is completed, the generator will automatically perform the necessary actions.
